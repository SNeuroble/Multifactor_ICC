# Generalizability Theory ICC toolbox

*Purpose:* Calculate ICC coefficients including multiple sources of error (i.e., facets) and perform Decision Study.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Matlab (tested with Matlab 2018b).

### Usage

1. Create data and factor table variables. This can be accomplished using the *load\_reliability\_data* script, which automatically creates a factor table from the filenames. This can be changed for your data or data can be loaded manually (try "help load\_reliability\_data" for more info on the format). 

2. Run reliability analysis. Example: *[icc,var,stats,sigmask]=run\_reliability(data',data,'factors',ftbl)*. Try "help run\_reliability" for more info. This will result in average D- and G-coefficients, a Decision Study visualization, and a variable "icc" which contains detailed ICC results.
